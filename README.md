## About
Trigger Visualizer replaces the editor textures of multiple trigger types to improve readability and visual clarity while building levels.

Originally focused only on shader triggers, the mod now also updates textures for other default trigger categories, including:
- <cb>Shader triggers</c>
- <cy>Object Edit triggers</c>
- <cr>Area triggers</c>
- <cp>Logical triggers</c>

This makes different trigger types easier to recognize and work with in complex setups.

---

### Customization
In <cg>this mod’s settings</c>, you can enable or disable texture changes for specific trigger categories.

This allows you to keep the default look for certain triggers (such as <cr>area</c> or <cp>shader</c> triggers) while still using custom visuals for others.

---

### Notes
- This mod only affects the **editor**.
- Gameplay behavior of triggers is not modified.
