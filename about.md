## About
Trigger Visualizer improves editor readability by updating textures across multiple trigger types.  
Originally focused on shader triggers, it now supports a wide range of default triggers:

- <cb>Shader triggers</c>
- <cy>Gameplay triggers</c>
- <cr>Area triggers</c>
- <cp>Logical triggers</c>
- <cc>Cameras triggers</c>

Dynamic textures are now available for:

- SFX triggers
- Event triggers
- UI triggers
- Item comp triggers

These updates make trigger types easier to identify and manage, especially in complex levels.

---

## Customization
In <cg>the mod settings</c>, you can:

- Enable or disable texture changes for specific trigger categories.
- Enable or disable **dynamic textures** for SFX, Event, UI, and Item comp triggers.
- Set a **volume threshold** for SFX triggers to control texture updates.
- Adjust the **spacing between textures** for Event triggers.
- Toggle dynamic textures directly in the editor with the new button.

This allows mixing default and custom visuals as needed.

## Notes
- Only affects the **editor**.
- Gameplay behavior of triggers remains unchanged.
