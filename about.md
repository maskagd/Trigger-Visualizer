## About
Trigger Visualizer significantly improves editor readability by replacing default trigger textures with clearer and more informative visuals.

The mod contains **211 unique custom textures** and modifies **79 different trigger types**, covering most commonly used triggers in the editor.

Originally focused on shader triggers, it now supports a wide range of default triggers:

- <cb>Shader triggers</c>
- <cy>Gameplay triggers</c>
- <cr>Area triggers</c>
- <cp>Logical triggers</c>
- <cc>Camera triggers</c>

Additionally, **14 trigger types feature dynamic textures**.  
These textures **change depending on trigger settings**, making complex setups much easier to read and debug.

Dynamic textures are available for:

- SFX trigger  
- Event trigger  
- UI trigger  
- Item comp and edit trigger   
- StartPos trigger  
- And more 

These improvements allow fast visual identification of trigger behavior directly inside the editor, without opening settings panels.

## Customization
In <cg>the mod settings</c>, you can:

- Enable or disable texture replacements for specific trigger categories.
- Enable or disable **dynamic textures** for supported triggers.
- Set a **volume threshold** for SFX triggers to control texture changes.
- Adjust the **spacing between textures** for Event triggers.
- Toggle dynamic textures directly in the editor using the new button.

This allows flexible mixing of default and custom visuals.

## Notes
